  "bio": "I’ve been building products on the web professionally for a little over 10 years. I specialize in strategic UX design and web development with a penchant for clear information architecture, design systems, and bespoke frontends. \n\nI have worked with agencies, startups, non-profits, artists, small vendors, medium SaaS companies, and large corporations. I’m used to mediating between business, product, and development teams. I have experience leading design initiatives, establishing design processes, and shaping the overall design direction of organizations. \n\nI strive to approach my practice with a critical eye, stemming from my eclectic academic background in complex systems and emergent technologies. \n\nBesides day-to-day work, I dabble with 3D printing, parametric and generative design, programming microcontrollers, digging through records, and collecting obscure books. These days, many of these activities are now on the back burner as I spend more time with my little daughter."
