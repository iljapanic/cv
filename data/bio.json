  "bio": "<p>I’ve been building products on the web for 10+ years. I specialize in strategic UX design and web development with a penchant for clear information architecture, design systems, and bespoke frontends.</p><p>I have worked with agencies, startups, non-profits, artists, small vendors, medium SaaS companies, and large corporations. I’m used to mediating between business, product, and development teams. I have experience leading design initiatives, establishing design processes, and shaping the overall design direction of organizations.</p><p>I strive to approach my practice with a critical eye, stemming from my eclectic academic background in complex systems and emergent technologies.</p><p>When I’m not pushing pixels or writing code for the web, I dabble with 3D printing, parametric design, programming sensors, and reading obscure books. Even though, many of these activities are now on the back burner as I spend more time with my little daughter.</p>"
